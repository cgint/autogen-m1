There are two csv files located in directory /app/tasks/task1/. t1.csv and t2.csv.
I want you to write a python script that merges the two files into one file using out.csv as filename.
The join column is named common_id.
Create state of the art and professional code. Use a library where possible so the code stays clean and maintainable.
Write the python script to a file named "solution.py" as soon as it is finished and works correctly.
All produced files should be stored in /app/output/ folder.
