There are two csv files located in directory /app/input/task1/. t1.csv and t2.csv.
The join column is named common_id.
Write a correct python script that merges the two files into one file using out.csv as filename.
Store the python script to a file named "solution.py" in /app/output/ as soon as it is finished and works correctly.
Create state of the art and professional code. Use a library where possible so the code stays clean and maintainable.
